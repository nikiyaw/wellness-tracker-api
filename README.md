# Wellness Tracker API

## Overview
The Wellness Tracker API is a robust backend service designed to help users log and manage personal wellness activities. The core purpose of this API is to 
provide a digital journal for tracking daily habits, workouts, and recipes, offering a foundation for a comprehensive wellness application. This project 
serves as a practical demonstration of building a RESTful API from the ground up, with a focus on core backend principles, including database management, user 
authentication, and API endpoint design.

## Features
### Current Functionality
- **User Management:** Secure user registration, authentication, and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Habit Tracking:** CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing a user's habits. Each habit is securely tied to a specific user, ensuring data privacy.
### Future Enhancements
- **Workout Management:** Endpoints for logging and tracking various workout routines, including resistance training, cardio and more.
- **Recipe Journal:** Functionality to save and manage sustainable recipes for easy future references.
- **Progress Visualization:** API endpoints to provide aggregated data and statistics for user habits and workouts.
